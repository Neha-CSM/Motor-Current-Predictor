# Motor-Current-Predictor
Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict motor current from linear acceleration and angular velocity. Implemented Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and an XGBoost regressor. Leveraged ONNX Runtime to achieve a 1.5x inference speedup when converting XGBoost to ONNX enabling pipeline deployment on resource constrained hardware.
